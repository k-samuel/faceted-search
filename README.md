# PHP Faceted search library 3.x

Simple and fast faceted search without external servers like ElasticSearch and others.

Easily handles 500,000 products with 10 properties. Divide the indexes into product groups or categories and for a long time you will not need scaling and more serious tools.
Works especially effectively with Roadrunner, Swoole etc.

In addition to faceted filters, also supports exclusion filters.

Optimized for high performance.

[Changelog](./changelog.md) | [2.x version](https://github.com/k-samuel/faceted-search/tree/2.x)

## Install

`
composer require k-samuel/faceted-search
`

## Aggregates
The main advantage of the library is the quick and easy construction of aggregates.

Simply about aggregates.

<img align="left" width="100" vspace="4" hspace="4" src="https://github.com/k-samuel/faceted-search/blob/master/docs/filters.png">
We have selected a list of filters and received as a result a list of products suitable for these filters.

In the user interface, we need to display only the general types of filters for the selected products and the number
of products with a specific filter value (intersection).

When user select each new parameter in the filters, we need to calculate the list of available options and their number
for new results.

This is easy enough. Even if the goods have a different structure of properties.
```php
<?php
  $query = (new AggregationQuery())->filters($filters);
  $filterData = $search->aggregate($query);
```


## Notes

_* Create index for each product category or type and index only required fields._


Use database to keep frequently changing fields (price/quantity/etc) and facets for pre-filtering.

You can decrease the number of processed records by setting records list to search in.
For example: list of ProductId "in stock" to exclude not available products.

## Performance tests

Tests on sets of products with 10 attributes, search with filters by 3 fields.

 *(Apple M2 macOS 14.0)*

*Since version 0.3.3, the index structures in PHP and Golang have diverged due to the peculiarities of the 
implementation of hasMap in languages. In Go, hashMap had to be abandoned in favor of a more efficient storage 
structure in slices, this allowed us to catch up with the performance of PHP.*

*In PHP array (hashMap) is more CPU efficient by using doubleLinkedList and hashMap key packing.*

*There are more efficient ways in Go to reduce the size of a slice without making a copy (used for list deduplication). 
It allows make intersection using iteration through sorted slices.*

*Further comparison does not make sense in view of the difference in algorithms.*

## Examples

Create index using console/crontab etc.
```php
<?php
use KSamuel\FacetedSearch\Index\Factory;

// Create search index with ArrayStorage using Factory method
$search = (new Factory)->create(Factory::ARRAY_STORAGE);
$storage = $search->getStorage();
/*
 * Get products data from DB
 */
$data = [
    ['id'=>7, 'color'=>'black', 'price'=>100, 'sale'=>true, 'size'=>36],   
    ['id'=>9, 'color'=>'green', 'price'=>100, 'sale'=>true, 'size'=>40], 
    // ....
];

foreach($data as $item){ 
   $recordId = $item['id'];
   // no need to add faceted index by id
   unset($item['id']);
   $storage->addRecord($recordId, $item);
}

// You can optionally call index optimization before using (since v2.2.0). 
// The procedure can be run once after changing the index data. 
// Optimization takes a few seconds, you should not call it during the processing of user requests.
$storage->optimize();

// save index data to some storage 
$indexData = $storage->export();
// We will use file for example
file_put_contents('./first-index.json', json_encode($indexData));
```

Using in application

```php
<?php
use KSamuel\FacetedSearch\Index\Factory;
use KSamuel\FacetedSearch\Search;
use KSamuel\FacetedSearch\Filter\ValueFilter;
use KSamuel\FacetedSearch\Filter\ExcludeValueFilter;
use KSamuel\FacetedSearch\Filter\ValueIntersectionFilter;
use KSamuel\FacetedSearch\Filter\RangeFilter;
use KSamuel\FacetedSearch\Query\SearchQuery;
use KSamuel\FacetedSearch\Query\AggregationQuery;
use KSamuel\FacetedSearch\Query\Order;

// load index by product category (use request params)
$indexData = json_decode(file_get_contents('./first-index.json'), true);
$search = (new Factory)->create(Factory::ARRAY_STORAGE);
$search->setData($indexData);

// get request params and create search filters
$filters = [
    // Values to search 
    new ValueFilter('color', ['black','green']), // ANY OF  (OR condition)
    // RangeFilter example for numeric property ranges (min - max)
    new RangeFilter('size', ['min'=>36, 'max'=>40]),
    // You can exclude records with specific values using ExcludeValueFilter / ExcludeRangeFilter
    new ExcludeValueFilter('type', ['used']),

    // You can select items with required multiple values of each record
    // Can be used for items with multiple field values:
    // ['id'=>2, 'brand'=>'Pony', 'purpose'=>['hunting', 'fishing', 'sports']]
    new ValueIntersectionFilter('purpose', ['hunting','fishing']) // AND condition
];
// create SearchQuery
$query = (new SearchQuery())->filters($filters);
// Find records using filters. Note, it doesn't guarantee sorted result
$records = $search->query($query);
// Now we have filtered list of record identifiers.
// Find records in your storage and send results into client application.

// Also we can send acceptable filters values for current selection.
// It can be used for updating client UI.
$query = (new AggregationQuery())->filters($filters);
$filterData = $search->aggregate($query);

// If you want to get acceptable filters values with items count use $search->aggregate
// note that filters is not applied for itself for counting
// values count of a particular field depends only on filters imposed on other fields.
// Sort results using $query->sort(direction,flags)
$query = (new AggregationQuery())->filters($filters)->countItems()->sort();
$filterData = $search->aggregate($query);


// If $filters is an empty array [] or not passed into AggregationQuery, all acceptable values will be returned
$query = (new AggregationQuery());
$filterData = $search->aggregate($query);

// You can sort search query results by field using FacetedIndex
$query = (new SearchQuery())->filters($filters)->sort('price', Order::SORT_DESC);
$records = $search->query($query);


```

### Indexers

To speed up the search of RangeFilter by data with high variability of values, you can use the Range Indexer.
For example, a search on product price ranges. Prices can be divided into ranges with the desired step.

Note that RangeFilter is slow solution, it is better to avoid facets for highly variadic data

```php
<?php
use KSamuel\FacetedSearch\Index\Factory;
use KSamuel\FacetedSearch\Search;
use KSamuel\FacetedSearch\Indexer\Number\RangeIndexer;
use KSamuel\FacetedSearch\Filter\RangeFilter;

$search = (new Factory)->create(Factory::ARRAY_STORAGE);
$storage = $search->getStorage();
$rangeIndexer = new RangeIndexer(100);
$storage->addIndexer('price', $rangeIndexer);

$storage->addRecord(1,['price'=>90]);
$storage->addRecord(2,['price'=>100]);
$storage->addRecord(3,['price'=>150]);
$storage->addRecord(4,['price'=>200]);

$filters = [
  new RangeFilter('price', ['min'=>100,'max'=>200])
];

$query = (new SearchQuery())->filters($filters);
$search->query($query);

// will return [2,3,4]
```

Sorting within ranges is possible only during the initial creating of index, since the connection with the real value is lost. 
Therefore, when using the RangeIndexer, you should not use adding new single values after a complete rebuild. 
As a workaround new values will be added to the end of range and be sorted only inside new values. 
This is relevant only for cases with sorting by field indexed by RangeIndexer.


RangeListIndexer allows you to use custom ranges list
```php
<?php
use KSamuel\FacetedSearch\Index\Factory;
use KSamuel\FacetedSearch\Indexer\Number\RangeListIndexer;

$search = (new Factory)->create(Factory::ARRAY_STORAGE);
$storage = $search->getStorage();
$rangeIndexer = new RangeListIndexer([100,500,1000]); // (0-99)[0],(100-499)[100],(500-999)[500],(1000 & >)[1000] 
$storage->addIndexer('price', $rangeIndexer);
```
Also, you can create your own indexers with range detection method


### FixedArrayIndex

FixedArrayIndex is much slower but requires significant less memory.

The stored index data is compatible, you can transfer it from ArrayIndex to FixedArrayIndex

```php
<?php
use KSamuel\FacetedSearch\Index\Factory;

$search = (new Factory)->create(Factory::FIXED_ARRAY_STORAGE);
$storage = $search->getStorage();
/*
 * Getting products data from DB
 * Sort data by $recordId before using Index->addRecord it can improve performance 
 */
$data = [
    ['id'=>7, 'color'=>'black', 'price'=>100, 'sale'=>true, 'size'=>36],   
    ['id'=>9, 'color'=>'green', 'price'=>100, 'sale'=>true, 'size'=>40], 
    // ....
];
foreach($data as $item){ 
   $recordId = $item['id'];
   // no need to add faceted index by id
   unset($item['id']);
   $storage->addRecord($recordId, $item);
}
// You can optionally call index optimization before using (since v2.2.0). 
// The procedure can be run once after changing the index data. 
// Optimization takes a few seconds, you should not call it during the processing of user requests.
// Can be called only in write mode of FixedArrayIndex
$storage->optimize();
// save index data to some storage 
$indexData = $storage->export();
// We will use file for example
file_put_contents('./first-index.json', json_encode($indexData));

// Index data is fully compatible. You can create both indexes from the same data 
$arrayIndex = (new Factory)->create(Factory::ARRAY_STORAGE);
$arrayIndex->setData($indexData);
```

### Filter Self-filtering condition

Aggregates disables property self-filtering by default. It allow the user to choose another option in the interface.

Example:
User wants a phone with 32GB memory, checks the box for the desired option from (16, 32, 64). 
If self-filtering is enabled, then all other options in the UI will disappear and only 32 will remain. 
Thus, user will not be able to change his choice.

During aggregation field filter value is used to limit values only other fields. 
Example: the "size" filter condition uses to limit the list of "brand" field variations.

All depends on your use case of the library. 
Initially, the library was developed to simplify the construction of a search UI.
If you want to use the library at the level of technical analysis, statistics, etc. , then enabling self-filtering can help you to get expected results.

For all filters:
```php
$query = (new AggregationQuery())->filters($filters)->countItems()->sort()->selfFiltering(true);
```

For individual filter:
```php
$filters[] = (new ValueIntersectionFilter('size', [12,32]))->selfFiltering(true);
```
